## Reporting problems

* Please make sure this bug is not already present in the issue tracker.
* Please provide as much details as possible for the problem, possibly
  including steps to reproduce or a test case that illustrates the issue.
* Please state if you would be able and willing to create a pull request for
  the issue.

## Making a suggestion for a change

* Please make sure this suggestion is not already present in the issue tracker.
* Please provide sufficient level of details in order to be able to start a
  meaningful discussion.

## Making a merge request

While trivial changes like fixing spelling of the documentation might not need
prior discussion, more complicated ones should generally be preceded by a
discussion in an issue in order to avoid wasted effort.

Please also note that no merge requests that breaks the build will be merged,
so it is strongly recommended to executed the tests on your local machine.

The library maintainer might request changes, for example, if the style of the
new code does not satisfy the coding conventions followed by the library (we
are aiming at following [this][1] style guide).
